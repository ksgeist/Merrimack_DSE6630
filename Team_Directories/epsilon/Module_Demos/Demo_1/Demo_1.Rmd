# Introduction

You have just been brought on as a data science consultant for a patient advocacy watchdog. They have asked you to source information about hospital readmissions, because they would like to flag specific geographic areas or types of hospitals where hospital readmission is unexpectedly high. They have heard that datasets exist to investigate these types of questions, but they are not really sure where to begin.

You remember this one data science class you took - and the dataset from the __Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services__ managed by [Medicare.gov](https://www.medicare.gov). You start poking around the [Hospitals](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/topics/hospitals) dataset and decide it is exactly what you need.

The problem is, this dataset is massive, so you are not only tasked with identifying a reasonable question you can ask from the dataset but managing the cleaning, pre-processing, and exploratory data analysis on the merged datasets you choose to explore.

## Question

For __Project 1__, you are going to choose your own question! But for this demo analysis, we are focusing on __pneumonia-related hospital readmissions__.

### Why pneumonia-related readmissions?

Hospital readmission rates for patients with pneumonia is almost unbelievably high, with about $\frac{1}{5}$ or 20% of patients hospitalized with pneumonia re-admitted within 30 days (de Alba and Amin, 2014). Further, pneumonia is both a leading cause of death among the elderly as well as a commonly communicated disease in hospitals (as in, people may come into a hospital for a different condition but be readmitted for pneumonia). Thus, given that pneumonia is the only communicable disease on this list, it is serving as our best proxy for diseases spread person-to-person within hospitals because of lack of availability.

#### Our research question:

Can we predict pneumonia-related hospital readmissions and, more generally, disease transfer within hospitals, based on hospital-level characteristics, including patient-ratings, Medicare money received, and other indicators of general performance in disease diagnosis and prevention?

#### Our hypothesis & prediction:

Hospitals are, by their very nature, hot zones for increased spread of disease, including pneumonia. We hypothesize that hospitals with lower indicators of patient care performance and lower Medicare funding rates will generally be unable to provide sufficient control of specific disease diagnosis and prevention, like pneumonia. This is because the same intrinsic and extrinsic factors that impact general patient quality of care is likely to extend to pneumonia, a _common, preventable, and treatable_ disease. Thus, we specifically predict that factors indicating lower quality-of-care will predict higher than average rates of pneumonia-related hospital readmissions.

## Objective

Our objective for the patient advocacy watchdog is clean, merge, explore, and predict which hospitals tend to have higher-than-average rates of pneumonia-related readmissions. This is to enable the watchdog group to put together      `a dashboard or otherwise deploy this information to share with patients so they know how their local hospitals are performing, allowing them to make healthier, more informed choices.

# Data & Data Cleaning

1. Download the [Hospitals](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/topics/hospitals) dataset as a zip directory. 
2. Unzip the directory. 
3. Make sure to adjust the name and/or path of the directory in your directory if it is different from mine. *Note that mine is living on my Desktop.*

**WARNING!** Do not try to put these data onto GitHub. They are too large to push. If you need help adjusting your path or have questions, please let me know.

```{r}
## Make sure to adjust your path!
filepath <- "C:\\Users\\mike_\\OneDrive\\Documents\\School\\Healthcare Analytics\\hospitals_current_data\\"
```


### Read in the hospital-level data iteratively, while dynamically naming & storing each file as a dataframe.

You may have to dig through the accompanying data dictionary **HOSPITAL_Data_Dictionary.pdf** to get a better handle on what is in the hospital-level files. 

##### **Question 1**: [1 point] 
Take a look at the chunk below, which performs **dynamic variable assignment** as it reads in each of the files. Your task is to add a comment to each line of code to describe what that line does.

> Your answer in the code chunk as comments. Make sure to use the `#` sign!

```{r}
## generate a list of files in the already-set directory path, where the filename contains "Hospital.csv"
files <- list.files(path = filepath, pattern = "Hospital.csv")

## iterate 1 -> number of found files
for(f in 1:length(files)) {
    ## using the filename at i
    ## - generate a full file path concatenating the filepath and filename[i]
    ## - open and read the data from the file, assuming its a csv, and do not show the column types
    ## - once the csv is turned into a dataframe, clean the column names of the dataframe using a cmel-cased format
    ## - assign to the `dat` variable
    dat <- clean_names(read_csv(paste0(filepath, files[f]),
                                show_col_types = FALSE), 
                       case = "upper_camel")
    
    ## remove the pattern ".Hospital.csv" from the file name, assign it to the `filename` var
    filename <- gsub(".Hospital\\.csv", "", files[f])
    ## name the data frame to this cleaned string
    assign(filename, dat)
}

## generate a vector of the filenames, removing the ".Hospital.csv" pattern then turn that vector into a DF
files <- gsub(".Hospital\\.csv", "", files) %>% data.frame()
## name the DF "File Name"
names(files) <- "File Name"
```

#### Now, let's look at a list of the files that we've read in:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
files %>% 
  kable(
    format = "html",
    caption = "Table 1. List of hospital-level data files.") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", full_width = F)
  )
```

##### **Question 2**: [1 point] 
Take a look at some of the dataframes, e.g., `HCAHPS` and `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program`. What do you notice about the format / structure of the data? Does the data have an issue with the dimensionality? 
**Hint: **Check to see if each row represents a single line of data or not!

Your answer here.
```{r}
## In the HCAHPS dataset, each observation is a measure of a specific metric, per hospital. This results in multiple observations per hospital.
## In the FY_2025_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program data set, the data is also the measure of a specific metric (in this case readmission rates) for particular medical issues. Each observation is a measure of readmission data for a particular issue, per hospital. This results in multiple observations per hospital.

## Both of these data sets are low in dimensionality (a relatively small amount of variables compared to the number of observations (n))

```

### Tidy the data response variables' dataframe: Fiscal Year 2024 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.
We are going to focus on the dataset `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program` to work on best practices to [tidy our data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). Although I do not personally choose to follow everything that Hadley Wickham and the __Tidy Data__ Movement has espoused, I do think a lot of the best practices are useful principles especially when we are just getting use to working with data. Further, we can leverage a lot of the functions to make our lives MUCH easier! And who doesn't like easier?!

##### **Question 3**: [1 point] 
Take a deeper look at `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program` at some of the numeric variables in the dataset, e.g., `NumberOfReadmissions`? 

Your answer here.
```{r}
## Based on Wickham's notes, a messy dataset has some of the following characteristics:
## • Column headers are values, not variable names.
## • Multiple variables are stored in one column.
## • Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
## • Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
## • A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables

## Looking at the FY_2025_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program dataset, we don't seem to have these problems.
## However, the data itself does appear to have a problem:
##  - A number of N/As that need to be addressed
##  - Character data in a numerically-intended column ("Too few to report")

## We could improve this data set by:
##  - removing all rows representing medical issues we don't care about (e.g not pneumonia)
##  - remove columns not directly related to summarizing readmission rates
##  - optionally pivot the dataset to achieve a column format like 
##    - <hospital demographics>
##    - Discharges of Pneumonia
##    - Readmissions of Pneumonia

```

**Hint: **Columns 5 & 7:10 have problems with the `NA` class.

##### **Question 4**: [1 point] 
Investigate the `replace_with_na_all()` function that is part of the `naniar` package. Use this function to fix the `NA` class in the aberrant columns in `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program`.

```{r}
# ?replace_with_na_all
# Your code here.

## Replace values in columns that are either == "N/A" with proper NAs
df_readmissions <- FY_2025_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program
df_readmissions <- replace_with_na_all(data = df_readmissions, condition =  ~ .x %in% c("N/A"))

```

You will notice that this aberrant class of missing value __caused__ the numeric columns to be coerced into character columns when they were imported by `read_csv()`. Although we could try using `as.numeric()` by itself, which would assign `NA` to any non-numeric entry in `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program`, the problem is that we could lose important information that way. Thus, as annoying as this is, we should fix it a little more specifically...

##### **Question 5**: [1 point] 
Look more closely at the `NumberOfReadmissions` column in the `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program`. What other issue do you see with this specific column that is coercing it to the character type, and why does it exist? 

**Hint: ** Make sure to use the accompanying data dictionary **HOSPITAL_Data_Dictionary.pdf** to also examine **WHY** this problem exists!

Your answer here.
```{r}
head(unique(df_readmissions$NumberOfReadmissions))

## There is text "Too Few to Report" that is showing up in the NumberOfReadmissions column. According to the data dictionary, this is caused:
## - When the number of cases/patients does not meet the required minimum amount for public reporting;
## - When the number of cases/patients is too small to reliably tell how well a hospital is performing; and/or
## - To protect personal health information.

```

##### **Question 6**: [1 point] 
Investigate the `gsub()` function that is part of base `R` or any other function of your choosing. Use the function you choose to **replace** the problematic text in  the `NumberOfReadmissions` column in `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program` with a **5**.
```{r}
# ?gsub
# Your code here.

df_readmissions <- df_readmissions %>%
  mutate(
    NumberOfReadmissions = case_when(
      NumberOfReadmissions == "Too Few to Report" ~ 5,
      TRUE ~ as.numeric(NumberOfReadmissions)
    )
  )

## unique(df_readmissions$NumberOfReadmissions)
```

##### **Question 7**: [1 point] 
Speculate as to why I asked you to replace the text with a **5** rather than a **0** or an `NA`. Can you think of any other logical choices for the substitution? Do you agree with my choice? (You're free to disagree, but please defend your decision either way!)

Your answer here.
```{r}
## According to the data dictionary, this constant is included when the data is too low for adequate reporting and / or to prevent deanonymization.
## Why use "5"?
median(df_readmissions$NumberOfReadmissions[!is.na(df_readmissions$NumberOfReadmissions)])
mean(df_readmissions$NumberOfReadmissions[!is.na(df_readmissions$NumberOfReadmissions)])
sd(df_readmissions$NumberOfReadmissions[!is.na(df_readmissions$NumberOfReadmissions)])

counts <- df_readmissions %>%
  filter(!is.na(NumberOfReadmissions)) %>%
  group_by(NumberOfReadmissions) %>%
  summarise(
    num = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(num))

## Looks like "5" is the most common non-NA value, makes sense to use it in lieu of another constant
head(counts)

```


##### **Question 8**: [1 point] 
Now, imagine an alternative scenario where instead of replacing it with a **5**, I instead asked you to replace it with a randomly sampled integer from 1 to 10. What would this do? Would `gsub()` work here or would I need to execute it a different way, e.g., with an `lapply()` function or a `for()` loop?

Your answer here.
```{r}
## lapply would work as it performs a function across a vector. A function could be written to return a random int value, then use lapply to assign the random id to every NumberOfReadmission variables that are "Too Few to Report"

```


##### **Question 9**: [3 points] 
You probably anticipated this! We just decided that, rather than a **5** we want a randomly sampled integer from 1 to 10. 

**Hint 1: **You might find it easier to read the data in from fresh and, after commenting out your `gsub` from Question 5, pattern match on the problematic text.

**Hint 2: **This is NOT the only way to do this, but I solved this using `gregexpr()`, `regmatches()`, and `lapply()`.

```{r}
## Create a test data set for this question

df_test <- FY_2025_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program
df_test <- replace_with_na_all(data = df_test, condition =  ~ .x %in% c("N/A"))
```

```{r}
if_invalid_set_random_int <- function(val) {
  ## if the value is not NA and is equal to our target, return a random int
  ## - "is.na()" required as NA cannot be compared to a string
  if(!is.na(val) & as.character(val) == "Too Few to Report"){
    return(sample(10,1))
  }
  else{
    return(val)
  }
}

df_test$NumberOfReadmissions <- lapply(df_test$NumberOfReadmissions, if_invalid_set_random_int)
```

##### **Question 10**: [1 point] 
It is finally time to fix those aberrant character columns by making them  numeric. However, just using `as.numeric()` would require us to do it over and over on each of the columns in multiple lines of code. Instead, investigate the function `mutate_at()` which will allow you to pass it a list of columns you want to convert with the function you want to use.
```{r}
# ?mutate_at
# Your code here.

summary(df_readmissions)

df_readmissions <- df_readmissions %>%
  mutate_at(
    .funs = as.numeric, 
    .vars = c("NumberOfDischarges", "ExcessReadmissionRatio", "PredictedReadmissionRate", "ExpectedReadmissionRate")
  )

summary(df_readmissions)
```

#### Let's look more closely at Measure Names.
Notice, that what I have done here first is used the `gsub()` function to `mutate()` the `MeasureName` column to remove the text that flanked the medical conditions.
```{r}
df_readmissions <-  df_readmissions %>%
  mutate(MeasureName = gsub("READM-30-", "", MeasureName)) %>% 
  mutate(MeasureName = gsub("-HRRP", "", MeasureName)) 
```

**Note:** If at this point you've had any issues with any of the previous problems 2-10, you can load the cleaned readmissions data, `readmissionsClean.Rdata` so that you can proceed with the assignment.

```{r}
## load(file = "readmissionsClean.Rdata")
```

##### **Question 11**: [1 point] 
Investigate the function `pivot_wider()` or `spread()` from the `tidyr` package, which comes bundled with `tidyverse`. Try pivoting the `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program` dataset wider. Make sure you correctly identify the `names_from` and `values_from` column(s). **Make sure to save it as a separate dataframe called `wideDF`.** Use the `dim()` function to prove to me that you successfully pivoted wider.

```{r}
# Your code here.

df_wide <- df_readmissions %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = MeasureName,
    values_from = NumberOfReadmissions
  )

dim(df_wide)
```

### Filtering for specific conditions.
Ideally, though, before we'd pivot wider we would decide if we were going to filter for any specific hospital readmission conditions. For your __Project 1__, you will be choosing which medical condition(s) you want to focus on for predicting hospital readmission. However, for the remainder of this demo, we're going to focus on just __pneumonia__. 

__Ideas you might consider for your Project_1 are:__

* surgical interventions (`HIP-KNEE`, `CABG`)
* heart-related conditions (`HF`, `AMI`, & `CABG`)
* all conditions (warning: this might be too unwieldy!)
* any other condition(s) that you motivate with a statement or two in support

Therefore, let's filter for just pneumonia-related readmissions which will actually eliminate the need to pivot wider in just this case (because we only chose a single condition).
```{r}
df_readmissions <- df_readmissions %>% 
  filter(MeasureName == "PN")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dict <- tribble(
  ~Acronym, ~Definition,
  "HIP-KNEE", "Total Hip/Knee Arthroplasty",
  "HF", "Heart Failure",
  "COPD", "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease",
  "AMI", "Acute Myocardial Infarction",
  "CABG", "Coronary Artery Bypass Graft",
  "PN", "Pneumonia"
)
dict %>% 
  kable(
    format = "html",
    caption = "Table 2. Acronyms of medical conditions for which hospital readmissions are tracked.") %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", full_width = F)
  )
```

It's important to understand that these medical conditions are the **ones that Medicaid/Medicare tracks for hospital readmissions**. These are not the only conditions in which a patient might be readmitted, but these are the ones that the agency uses to keep track of hospital performance.

### Dynamic creation of merged dataframe objects: supporting dataframes.

We will often be asked to deal with large, unwieldy datasets and sometimes we need to be able to handle them dynamically. __Dynamic variable assignment__, as I demonstrated when we read in the files, is going to come in handy - but it can sometimes be tricky to accomplish. The whole point, though, is to create code that can handle ANYTHING you throw at it. 

In a similar vein, we can also perform __dynamic dataframe creation__ when we need to modify and stitch together more than one pre-existing dataframe - ESPECIALLY when we might decide down the line to alter our choices by adding or removing other dataframes.

#### Writing your own function to create objects dynamically.

We are going to take all the cleaning steps we did above that was not specific to the `FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program` dataframe and tidy, pivot, & filter for specific readmission conditions, and iteratively join as many dataframes as needed. The goal is to make something flexible enough that, if you change a set of inputs, it will create a joined table from ANY set of dataframe inputs. There is more than one way to do this; but leveraging some of the existing `tidyverse` and `tidyr` functions will likely help you make this very flexible. Please note, however, that you do not have to use those packages.

I start you out with something I find helpful when joining together dataframes that sometimes have *redundant* columns BUT not every column is in every dataframe. I start by making a dataframe called `hospitalInfo` that contains the pertinent information on each hospital in the dataset, so you can drop those columns from the other dataframes to prevent inflation or issues when you later join the dataframes together. You may want to join each of the other dataframes to `hospitalInfo`. 

As I was writing my own version of this function, I found that the `Payment and Value of Care` table must be separated into two tables to join well, at least with how I wrote my function. So, I do that for you below. I also clean up `HCAHPS` to make it easier to work for the function I wrote, so it may also be useful for you. Note that what I'm doing in these cases is making sure that `MeasureName` is the title of the column **I will join my tables on.** In this way, I'm using the `MeasureName` as the **key** for my table joins. 


**First, make sure to separate the Payment and Values tables, giving each facility IDs:**

```{r}
paymentOnly <- Payment_and_Value_of_Care %>% 
  select(FacilityId, PaymentMeasureName, PaymentCategory, Payment) %>% 
  mutate(Payment = gsub("\\$", "", Payment)) %>% # Remove the dollar sign
  mutate(Payment = gsub("\\,", "", Payment)) %>% # Remove the comma 
  rename(MeasureName = PaymentMeasureName)  # Make consistent with other tables

valueOnly <- Payment_and_Value_of_Care %>% 
  select(FacilityId, ValueOfCareDisplayName, ValueOfCareCategory) %>% 
  rename(MeasureName = ValueOfCareDisplayName)  # Make consistent with other tables
```


**HCAHPS is also a mess. Remove the columns that we will never use in any analysis, make a `MeasureName` column, and also drop the " - linear mean score" from some rows in the newly minted `MeasureName`**

```{r}
HCAHPS <- HCAHPS %>% 
  select(-HcahpsMeasureId, -PatientSurveyStarRatingFootnote, 
         -HcahpsAnswerPercentFootnote, -NumberOfCompletedSurveysFootnote,
         -SurveyResponseRatePercentFootnote, -HcahpsAnswerDescription,
         -PatientSurveyStarRating) %>%  ## Drops the columns we don't need
  rename(MeasureName = HcahpsQuestion) %>%  ## Makes a new MeasureName column
  mutate(MeasureName = gsub(" - linear mean score", "", MeasureName))
  ## Takes off the phrase that we don't want
```

**Lastly, pull the hospital information off of the Payment and Value table because it is complete there. We can then drop this information from all the other tables:**

```{r}
hospitalInfo <- Payment_and_Value_of_Care %>% 
              ## Information about the hospitals
                select(FacilityId, FacilityName, Address, CityTown, 
                         State, ZipCode, CountyParish, TelephoneNumber)
```

##### **Question 12**: [5 points] 

Write a function that will:

1. Fix any issues identified previously, e.g., issues with the `NA` class or pivoting, if needed

2. Join any number of a list of dataframes you give it. For example, it should be able to join these 8 tables:

```{r}
datList <- list(Healthcare_Associated_Infections,
                paymentOnly,
                Outpatient_Imaging_Efficiency,
                Complications_and_Deaths,
                Medicare_Hospital_Spending_Per_Patient, 
                Timely_and_Effective_Care, 
                Unplanned_Hospital_Visits,
                HCAHPS)
```

3. Filters the data for given criteria and condition(s) prior to pivoting. For example, for the 8 tables listed above, perhaps to filter for these possible measures before pivoting, so that I'm not pivoting ALL of those measures! (That would likely crash R!). Notice that what we're filtering for - is really a selection criteria, but because the data are in **wide format**, we are selecting them by row (i.e., "filter") rather than selection by column (i.e., "select"). 

```{r}
filterList <- list("MRSA Bacteremia", 
                   "Payment for pneumonia patients", 
                   "Abdomen CT Use of Contrast Material", 
                   
                   c("Death rate for pneumonia patients", 
                     "Perioperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis rate",
                     "CMS Medicare PSI 90: Patient safety and adverse events composite", 
                     "Postoperative respiratory failure rate"),
                   
                   "Medicare spending per patient",
                   
                   c("Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination", 
                     "Percentage of healthcare personnel who completed COVID-19 primary vaccination series", 
                     "Average (median) time patients spent in the emergency department before leaving from the visit A lower number of minutes is better", 
                     "Left before being seen",
                     "Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis", 
                     "Intensive Care Unit Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis", 
                     "Emergency department volume"),
                   
                   "Hospital return days for pneumonia patients",
                   
                   c("Nurse communication",
                     "Doctor communication",
                     "Staff responsiveness",
                     "Communication about medicines",
                     "Discharge information",
                     "Care transition",
                     "Cleanliness",
                     "Quietness",
                     "Overall hospital rating",
                     "Recommend hospital")
)
```

4. For full credit, make sure that your function can clean up and join together at least three of the dataframes. **Note**: Make sure to join with `readmissionsClean` at the end!

Perhaps you will choose to start your function like this (although you do not have to):
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# tidyNjoin <- function(datList, filterList, hospitalInfo) {
# 
# }
```

* **Hint 1: **Feel free to drop the `startDate` and `endDate` columns, as well as the `footnote` column. I would even suggest dropping `MeasureId`.

* **Hint 2: **`select(-any_of(c(...)))` can be used to drop any of a list of columns, regardless of whether it exists in every dataframe or not.

* **Hint 3: **If you choose to drop all those extraneous columns, then the column you will need to merge/join on will always be in the second position, `MeasureName`.

* **Hint 4: **`full_join()` in `dplyr` is likely what you will need; you will want to execute the join on `FacilityId`.

* **Hint 5: **Make sure to check for and/or remove duplicate rows.

* **Hint 6: **If you are really stuck, move ahead and I give you a cleaned, merged data set to work with.

Okay, take a stab at it!

##### **Question 13**: [1 point] 
Why do you think I just made you work through this function? (**Hint**: What are you going to be asked to do in Project 1?)

Your answer here.
```{r}
## If I had to guess, we'll be needing to combine a number of datasets to accomplish our analysis.

```

### The full, merged, tidied dataset for pneumonia. 

Please load if you are struggling to get a function that performs the task or if you aren't sure if it does what's expected.

```{r}
## I'm using this moving forward - since I was working with the 2025 data above, I want to align on what's expected (2024 data)

load("pneumoniaFull.Rdata")
dim(pneumoniaFull)
```

As I mentioned in Question 12, I ultimately chose to merge 8 of the datasets together for this dataset, although I selectively filtered to focus on my question: **Can we predict pneumonia-related hospital readmissions based on factors that might indicate how well the hospital is doing at diagnostics and disease prevention?**

Whew! Notice that this dataset currently has **100 features** and **4,816 rows**. That's definitely too many features, so let's perform some additional feature selection.

**Let's start by examining the "big picture" of what's in this giant dataset**:

# Pre-processing & Feature Selection (Round 1)

**WARNING**: Typically we would do a lot of this work AFTER splitting into a training and testing set. I'm not having you do that today so that you can write code that will help you with your Project1. Just be aware that this goes against the typical workflow a bit.

Feature selection can take many forms, from what we've already done (choosing features relevant to our question) to culling non-informative columns to using more machine-guided approaches. We're going to leverage all types here.

Additionally, we are going to perform **encoding** to our categorical variables. It will be important to perform encoding **BEFORE** using automated methods for feature selection.

## Culling Features (and, yes, more tidying!)

Although we ideally could just include these steps (and perhaps you did!) in our tidying & joining function from Question 12, I wanted to make sure we talk about this explicitly. 

##### **Question 14**: [1 point] 
Looking through the feature names, you probably notice names like `LowerEstimate_Death rate for pneumonia patients`. We do not need the higher and lower estimates in this case; just the point estimates. Use the `contains()` function to **drop** any columns that contain `LowerEstimate` or `HigherEstimate`. Let's also go ahead and drop any columns containing `Denominator` and `HcahpsAnswerPercent` as well. How many features did you drop? 

Your answer here.
```{r}
# Your code here.
df_pneu <-pneumoniaFull %>%
  select(-contains(c("LowerEstimate", "HigherEstimate", "FacilityName", "TelephoneNumber", "Address", "CityTown")))
```

**Note:** Please drop `FacilityName`, `TelephoneNumber`, `Address`, & `CityTown` at this stage as well, if they're still in your full dataset.

```{r}
# see above
```

## Encoding

### Mystery encoding! (Well, it won't be a mystery for long.)

##### **Question 15**: [1 point] 
We need to perform encoding on all of the categorical columns, ultimately. However, we will focus first on the columns that begin with ``ComparedToNational_`, e.g., `ComparedToNational_Death rate for pneumonia patients`. What kind of encoding should we perform on these columns? Why? 

Your answer here.
```{r}
## Maybe ordinal encoding?

```


##### **Question 16**: [1 point] 
What other column do we also need to perform this kind of encoding on?

Your answer here.
```{r}
## PaymentCategory_*
## Score_Emergency department volume (although a different scale)

```

##### **Question 17**: [3 points] 
You probably expected this - attempt to encode those columns the method you selected. It's okay if you can only think of a way to brute-force this for now; I will show you code to help you do it faster after the assignment. :)

* **Hint 1: **You could use the `contains()` or `startsWith()` functions to help you quickly grab those columns so you can make the changes you want to make.

* **Hint 2: **You may want to explore the `grepl()` function or regular expressions, as they can allow us to match in a "fuzzy" way.

* **Hint 3: **You may want to create a temporary dataframe that you execute the changes on and then replace the original columns from there. That way, you don't have to keep reloading the original data if you make mistakes!

* **Hint 3: **For full credit, don't forget to double check that you managed to preserve all the data! The `table()` function is sufficient here.

**Note**: If you struggled with Question 17, load the data below and keep going:
```{r}
load("pneumoniaFullEncoded.Rdata")
```


### Frequency encoding state and county.
We also decide that we want a way to try to preserve and analyze the geographic information without causing terrible overfitting. So, we will try to apply **frequency encoding** to those two categorical columns.


##### **Question 18**: [1 points] 

Go through the **frequency encoding** code chunk below and comment each line. What does it do? *Make sure to comment why you think the choice was made*, if appropriate.

Your answer in comments in the code chunk.

```{r}
## the columns we want to encode
cols2encode <- c("State", 
               "CountyParish")

## make a df of the dataset, but only with the columns in cols2encode
temp <- pneumoniaFullEncoded[, names(pneumoniaFullEncoded) %in% cols2encode]

## define a function that takes a data frame and a column name
add_freq <- function(data, column_name) {
  ## create a table that tracks the frequency of each occurance of a value in the specified column_name of the data frame
  frequency_map <- table(data[[column_name]], useNA = "always")
  ## update the value of column_name to the value of the frequency for that value
  data[[column_name]] <- frequency_map[match(data[[column_name]],
                                             names(frequency_map))]
  return(data)
}

## iterate through the columns in the truncated temporary df
for (col in names(temp)) {
  ## call the function above
  temp <- add_freq(temp, col)
}

## update the original data set to match what was found in the test
for (c in 1:length(cols2encode)) {
  pneumoniaFullEncoded[, cols2encode[c]] <- temp[, cols2encode[c]]
}
```             


##### **Question 19**: [1 point] 

Use your finally & freshly encoded version of `pneumoniaFullEncoded` to answer this vital question for `State` and `CountyParish` features: are we justified using these features? Why or why not? You will need to write code to answer this question.

**Hint 1: **Use your original `pneumoniaFull` dataset to compare the features in `pneumoniaFullEncoded`.

**Hint 2: ** **Heavily** duplicated frequency values can make it ill-advised to proceed with a frequency encoded feature. Low to moderate duplication can be kept if there is a strong justification for doing so.

**Hint 3: **If you decide it is ill-advised for either or both columns, make sure to remove those features from the dataset!

```{r}
# Your code here.

## Our encoding system above encodes a numeric value to state & parish, which is the frequency of occurrance of those values in the data set.
## The problem is that these frequencies are not unique - two states could have the same frequency of 5 (for example), which will encode them to the same value.

df_pneu %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  select(count) %>%
  group_by(count) %>%
  summarize(
    count_of_count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count_of_count))

```

Your answer here.
```{r}
## Therefore, these columns should be removed
df_pneu <- df_pneu %>%
  select(-c("State","CountyParish"))

## also dropped in the code block below
```


### Finishing touches

#### 1. Ensure that every feature is numeric.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
load("pneumoniaAnalyze.Rdata")

pneumoniaAnalyze <- pneumoniaAnalyze %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.numeric)) %>%
  ## next line added by the student
  select(-c("State"))
```

#### 2. Collapse the `NumberOfCompletedSurveys_`... and `SurveyResponseRatePercent_`... features into a single one, as they are identical / redundant:

```{r}
pneumoniaAnalyze <- pneumoniaAnalyze %>% 
  ## arbitrarily chose as the rep as they are identical
  mutate(NumberSurveysCompleted = NumberOfCompletedSurveys_Cleanliness,              
         SurveyResponseRate = SurveyResponseRatePercent_Cleanliness/100) %>%       ## Turned into an actual rate 
  select(-contains(c("NumberOfCompletedSurveys_", "SurveyResponseRatePercent_")))   ## drop the others
```

Excellent! Now we are down to just 51 features...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## We can remove the datasets we are no longer using:
rm(pneumoniaFull, pneumoniaFullEncoded, Timely_and_Effective_Care, Unplanned_Hospital_Visits, valueOnly, Outpatient_Imaging_Efficiency, Payment_and_Value_of_Care, paymentOnly, readmissionsClean, valueOnly, hospitalInfo, Maternal_Health, Medicare_Hospital_Spending_Per_Patient, FY_2024_HAC_Reduction_Program, FY_2024_Hospital_Readmissions_Reduction_Program, files, HCAHPS, Healthcare_Associated_Infections, Complications_and_Deaths, dat, temp)
```


#### 3. Identify the target variable.

__Our very, very last steps!__ Your task is to identify the appropriate target variable from the dataset. I have purposefully not gone into great detail about what it would be because choosing the best target is sometimes tricky. 

##### **Question 20**: [2 points] 

Use `pneumoniaAnalyze` to calculate an  `observed_readmission_rate` as the number of readmissions divided by the number of discharges, multiplied by 100, then drop the two columns used to make this new one. Now, using the data and the data dictionary, try to understand the relationship between `observed_readmission_rate` that we just created, the `PredictedReadmissionRate`, `ExpectedReadmissionRate`, and the `ExcessReadmissionRatio`. What is the relationship? What is the appropriate target to choose and why? 

```{r}
pneumoniaAnalyze <- pneumoniaAnalyze %>%
  mutate(observed_readmission_rate = (NumberOfReadmissions / NumberOfDischarges) * 100) %>%
  select(-c("NumberOfReadmissions", "NumberOfDischarges")) 

## It looks like ExcessReadmissionRatio is the PredictedReadmissionRate / ExpectedReadmissionRate
## ExpectedReadmissionRate is the amount of readmissions based on similar hospitals
## PredictedReadmissionRate is the amount of readmissions based on that specific hospital's predictions

## Our target variable should be observed_readmission_rate as it predicts real-world outcomes

```

**Hint: **Think about (or perhaps try to investigate) why the **predicted** rate exists. What would be the (dis)advantage to using the predicted vs. the newly created `observed_readmission_rate`? 

```{r}
## Maybe the predicted value accounts for unknown variables specific to that hospital
```

##### **Question 21**: [1 points] 

Why did I have you drop the two columns used to make `observed_readmission_rate`?

```{r}
## If used in analysis, it could be considered a redundant variable
```


# Exploratory Data Analysis

For your final question, you will kick start our EDA by focusing on the target variable that you identified in Question 20. **You will not be penalized for choosing the wrong target as long as you made an attempt to choose and defend a rational choice.**

##### **Question 22**: [3 points] 

Explore the target variable you identified in Question 20 with at least one other variable. Try to push yourself to try a new style of plot; for example, have you ever made a `density` or `violin` plot? These can be excellent choices when exploring the distribution of a target variable against another variable. Note that, if you choose to compare the target against one of the encoded categorical variables, you will need to properly re-label the categories for your plot.

Full points are awarded for professional plots with axis labels, labeled legends (if appropriate), and creative use of multivariable information. **One bonus point will be awarded if you make a faceted plot or otherwise include information from at least 3 variables.** 

Need inspiration that comes with code?!? Check out the [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com)!

```{r}
# Your code here.

library(ggplot2)

unique(pneumoniaAnalyze$`Score_Emergency department volume`)

temp <- pneumoniaAnalyze %>%
  select(c("Score_Emergency department volume", "observed_readmission_rate"))

temp$`Score_Emergency department volume` <- factor(temp$`Score_Emergency department volume`, levels = c(2,3,4,5), labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High"))

temp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Score_Emergency department volume`, y = observed_readmission_rate, fill = `Score_Emergency department volume`)) +
    geom_violin()

```

Lastly, make sure to **interpret** your graphic.

```{r}
## I wanted to see if the volume of an ER affected readmission rates.
## Based on the plot, there isn't an obvious difference in readmission rates between the different volumes of ERs.

```
