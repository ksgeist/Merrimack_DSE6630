# README FOR DEMO_1

## R Project File:  `DSE6630_Demo_1.Rproj`
- Always open this file first; it will make everything sync together nicely if you do!

## Knitted HTML File:  `Demo_1.html`
- This is a knitted version of the RMarkdown file that is **human readable** and will make it much easier to learn concepts and do your assignment!
- You should update this regularly as you make changes as a best practice for your teammates.

## R Markdown File:  `Demo_1.Rmd`
- This is the working file where you will answer questions and do work.

## Provided .Rdata files: 
- These files are intended to help you if you get stuck at any point in the coding process so that you can skip a question and keep moving forward. 
- They are used/loaded in the code in the following order:

1.	`readmissionsClean.Rdata` = Cleaned readmissions data
2.	`pneumoniaFull.Rdata` = The full, merged, tidied dataset for pneumonia
3.	`pneumoniaFullEncoded.Rdata` = 3 features encoded as specified in the Demo
4.	`pneumoniaAnalyze.Rdata` = Takes `pneumoniaFullEncoded` and includes data type conversions, creation of all possible target variables for comparison, and collapsed variables as specified in the assignment

## References file: `references.bib`
- Necessary for knitting correctly. It includes the cited bibliography in knitted report.
