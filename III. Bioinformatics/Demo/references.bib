Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.},

            Bumble bees are common in cooler climates and many species likely experience periodic exposure to very cold temperatures, but little is known about the temporal dynamics of cold response mechanisms following chill exposure, especially how persistent effects of cold exposure may facilitate tolerance of future events. To investigate molecular processes involved in the temporal response by bumble bees to acute cold exposure, we compared mRNA transcript abundance in Bombus impatiens workers exposed to 0°C for 75 min (inducing chill coma) and control bees maintained at a constant ambient temperature (28°C). We sequenced the 3′ end of mRNA transcripts (TagSeq) to quantify gene expression in thoracic tissue of bees at several time points (0, 10, 30, 120 and 720 min) following cold exposure. Significant differences from control bees were only detectable within 30 min after the treatment, with most occurring at the 10 min recovery time point. Genes associated with gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were most notably upregulated, while genes related to lipid and purine metabolism were downregulated. The observed patterns of expression indicate a rapid recovery after chill coma, suggesting an acute differential transcriptional response during recovery from chill coma and return to baseline expression levels within an hour, with no long-term gene expression markers of this cold exposure. Our work highlights the functions and pathways important for acute cold recovery, provides an estimated time frame for recovery from cold exposure in bumble bees, and suggests that cold hardening may be less important for these heterothermic insects.},

    abstract = {Advances in neuroimaging, genomic, motion tracking, eye-tracking and many other technology-based data collection methods have led to a torrent of high dimensional datasets, which commonly have a small number of samples because of the intrinsic high cost of data collection involving human participants. High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.},
