## R Project File:  `DSE6630_Demo_2.Rproj`
- Always open this file first; it will make everything sync together nicely if you do!

## Knitted HTML File:  `Demo_2.html`
- This is a knitted version of the RMarkdown file that is **human readable** and will make it much easier to learn concepts and do your assignment!
- You should update this regularly as you make changes as a best practice for your teammates.

## R Markdown File:  `Demo_2.Rmd`
- This is the working file where you will answer questions and do work.

## Provided .Rdata files: 
- These files are intended to help you if you get stuck at any point in the coding process so that you can skip a question and keep moving forward. 
- They are used/loaded in the code in the following order:

1.	`stateAggPneumonia.Rdata` = State-level aggregated pneumonia dataset for students
2.	`2023_US_Census.csv` = U.S. Census data to import as a CSV file
3.	`loadTrainTest.R` = Source code that handles some data cleaning and joining for students
